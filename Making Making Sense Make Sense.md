## 1. Introduction

I was with my friend and his father. His dad had recently gifted me a jacket and suggested I wear it
downtown, to which I replied 'how risqu√©'. This got quite a laugh, and I attempted to follow it up
but realized I didn't understand the joke I had made. The implication, of course, was that I would
wear _only_ the jacket.

I remember how fast I made the joke. It was almost instant, and that was the problem. The conscious
part of my brain wasn't able to keep up with the predictive part. At that moment I was operating in
a responsive way; I wasn't thinking too hard about the conversation. The complexity of the statement
and context were easy for my frontal cortex (experience simulator) to solve in the abstract, but the
part of me that observes fell behind, likely overwhelmed by other inputs like vision and sound. It
isn't that I didn't understand the joke, it's that I didn't understand it _before_ I spoke.

## 2. Schizophrenia

The word schizophrenia is derived from Greek words meaning 'to split' and 'mind'. The corpus
callosum, in the middle of the brain, connects two larger hemispheres. You can think of it
as a bunch of high speed data cables. The schizophrenic's corpus callosum is smaller than average,
with fewer axons, leading to a reduction in communication. Can differing structural compositions of
our brains explain some of the psychological issues we collectively face?

Now, remember my story and imagine how this would be experienced. If different parts of our brains
are responsible for different tasks, to communicate internally in a fixed amount of time, the
schizophrenic brain must either send less information, or encode it more compactly. If this is
impossible, perhaps it can't be processed in time - leading to a jarring experience like mine.

A schizophrenic undergoing this effect may still be able to function while unable to understand
what's happening. Maybe they've been in a similar situation before, and that training allows them
to cope. Unfortunately, this is often short-lived. A cognitive feedback loop typically kicks in as
awareness to the change in context builds. What I'm trying to say is that after the schizophrenic
perceives themself act seemingly without their own control, they feel alienated from the experience
they've been told is expected and normal. Nothing prepares them for this, and it isn't the
schizophrenic's fault - it's a failure to identify this mechanism and adequately explain it.

The reaction can vary, but generally the mind goes to places like "I'm being controlled by ______"
(god, aliens, government). The fact that the feeling is brief can lead to a rationalization that the
control being exercised over the schizophrenic is temporary, that it can be _fought_. The mere fact
that it feels invasive makes it seem worthy of a fight.

Now, if we back up a bit, let's think about what happens if we reduce the amount of information
transferred and try to make sense of it. Can we? In some cases, probably yes. An example is to
remove the video from a film. Perhaps the same information can be conveyed, yet less bandwidth is
required to convey it. A high-fidelity reconstruction of the film from audio may not resemble the
original, but if the changed details are irrelevant, it wouldn't matter. For instance, you can
enjoy a symphony performance if you close your eyes, the audio details are enough. But what if
you're learning open heart surgery? Clearly this situation requires audio _and_ video, so reduced
bandwith presents a problem. This is when one needs to represent information more compactly, using
better encoding - being selective about the details and their structure.

When I lose something in my home, I simply think 'I need to find _x_.' Then, I forget about _x_ and
go on with my day. Typically, within a minute, I've moved to where I need to be and I'm staring at
_x_. I don't think about it, and I'm not actively remembering where it is. Yet, it's as if I've made
a request for something and that thing was delivered to me. It feels a lot like interacting with an
asynchronous messaging system.

Perhaps then, a well-trained brain with more isolation, like a schizophrenic's, can excel at
parallel processing. This may be the case for me. Those with similar cognitive architecture are
expected to learn to adapt, but what if conventional educational methods we train children with
aren't appropriate for those who process information atypically?

Something I recently become aware of is that there are few, if any, schizophrenics with congenital
blindness. I wonder if this is because the limitations I describe above don't present themselves in
a symptomatic way if the corpus callosum isn't saturated from processing vision - perhaps wired so
the part normally used by sighted people for vision was reallocated in the blind to permit higher
bandwidth communication between the rest of the brain.

## 3. Treatment

I spent two month-long stints in psych wards. Here's how it worked.

You are admitted, and you are not trusted. No matter what you say or do, they refuse to trust you
for a few days to a week. If you are lucky, at that point, you are allowed to leave for periods of
up to an hour with an escort. You are monitored while sleeping to ensure you cannot harm yourself,
you have no privacy.

I had access to an abundant supply of lorazepam, but, I wasn't allowed to smoke or drink. In
clinical trials (Creamer et al., Tobacco product use and cessation indicators among adults), 
only 7.5% of smokers are able to successfully quit. This is stress for the patient, at a time they
are effectively trying to prove to others that they can be calm.

Here are a few interesting facts I found about schizophrenics and smoking:
- 80-90% of schizophrenics smoke.
- There is evidence that nicotine may treat some symptoms of schizophrenia, so smoking acts as
  self-medication.
- One study found that schizophrenics on public assistance spend an average of 27% of their income
  on cigarettes.

During my second admission, I was locked in a facility with one small window for the first 24 hours
of my stay, after I was administered a drug that caused me to black out for about 18 hours. The
cause for my admission was complex, but ultimately the tipping point was that I was naked as my
mother came home from work (I was living with her at the time). It never fully made sense to me, but
my opinion didn't count by then. You lose most rights. I understand that I was indeed acting in a
way that could easily be characterized as irrational, but non-threatening behaviour shouldn't be a
reason to detain someone.

There's too much emphasis placed on making those in distress behave without eccentricity. There's
no tolerance for the unusual. I recall being passionate about my ideas while admitted, only to
find that the more passionate I was the less freedom I had. There is a distinction to be made here.
Understandably safety is a concern. But, I know that I'm careful to ensure I'm never placed in
care again, and this could come at the expense of my well-being and safety.

The sad part is that often, there's no threat - there's simply a disagreement between the
schizophrenic and the rest of society (or at least those in control of the schizophrenic's fate)
regarding belief.

I'm now medicated on aripiprazole - but all that does, quite honestly, is stop the thought loops.
What I mean by loops, is what I assume to be a hijacked reward prediction pathway that gets a bit
stuck. You try to focus on something else, but find you're thinking about that same old thing. It's
likely something you have no control over, something you wish you could change. You may be
simulating a desired outcome in your frontal cortex and altering dopamine release. This is quite
similar to addiction. Aripiprazole acts as a dopamine blocker, which (I think) allows me to
redirect these loops out of the reward cycle; I don't get stuck in a feedback loop. It hasn't
stopped me from noticing the things that trigger my psychosis, it's stopped me from focusing on
them.

The first psychiatric medication I was prescribed was lithium bicarbonate, when I was twenty-five. I
was diagnosed with bipolar, but stopped seeing the prescribing doctor after thinking he wasn't
listening to me. I took it for a few weeks. I would describe it as removing the glow from life.
It's kind of like anti-euphoria. I like to say it has the opposite effect of a three-quarter
gram dose of mushrooms. I hated it, but it did have an effect on my cannabis use. I didn't crave
cannabis while I was on it, but lithium didn't make me stop wanting to die (and later, the cause
for my first admission was labelled a suicidal gesture). At this point I should mention I was not
aware what positive and negative symptoms were until I was forty-three, and we could do much better
to educate those _with_ symptoms about how best to think of them and what to expect from drugs that
will alter aspects of their well-being.

I wasn't medicated again until I was thirty-five. I was given risperidone during my first admission,
which I took for about a month - and again, had no relief from negative symptoms at the expense of
sexual and cognitive side effects (no orgasms, groggy, drooling a bit). I built up a bit of a
tolerance to it over time and the grogginess improved slightly, but I was still tired.

During my second admission, I refused to be medicated. After an emotional argument with some
lawyers, and due to a 'lack of capacity to consent', my mother was given control over my medication.
During a hearing, I became exasperated at the situation and how I believed my rights weren't being
respected. I didn't have the best words to express myself, and my passion counted against me. I was
trying to argue that in other aspects of life I was trusted, so why not about this? Looking at the
larger picture, I see now that my well-being and interactions with others were suffering, but I
don't recall this being clearly explained to me as the justification for the decision.

I was held by two large men while they dosed me the first time, their assumption being that I may
fight back. They didn't ask me ahead of time if I planned to fight, they simply held me and told me
not to. The end result might have been positive, but the experience was terrible. Perhaps we should
qualify _why_ things are done for those in treatment. I wasn't told I would black out when I was
given that drug on admission. I don't even know the name of it.

I was injected with paliperidone. It had the same sexual side effects and a bit of the grogginess,
but the most concerning thing was that my tongue and mouth became a bit twitchy. I learned of
tardive dyskinesia, an irreversible movement disorder sometimes caused by antipsychotics, through a
television commercial - not a doctor or pharmacist. When I told them of my symptoms, I was finally
permitted another medication, and I have been on it since 2018.

At some point I also took citalopram for depressive symptoms but I recall that made me constipated,
gain weight, and have no orgasms.

I'm currently on 400mg of aripirazole administered every 28 days by injection. One thing about this
situation that could improve: I was given several intolerable drugs before finding one that wasn't.
From what I can tell, this sequence wasn't chosen to treat my symptoms earlier, more safely, or
based on the expectation of preference, but instead was selected because patents exist around
newer, more advanced, pricier medications. Branded aripiprazole is moderately expensive, and I
presume this is because no unbranded alternative can legally exist in my area. When I was first
prescribed this treatment, I paid over $500 out of pocket each month before being reimbursed. I'm
lucky that this reimbursement was even possible - I wasn't able to work at the time. Fortunately
the social care system I'm part of identified me (albeit on the second application) as requiring
support. The wholesale cost of this medication was $2388.47 (USD I presume) in February, 2021. In
many places, I simply wouldn't receive this treatment.

The ideas I'm proposing about structure and asynchrony of processing in the brain are ones I had on
my own after reading, thinking, and conversations with experts. I have never been in a targeted
psychiatric or psychological treatment program. I see a doctor once every couple years, when we have
an interview to make sure I'm feeling well and still able to fit into society. My blood chemistry
is also tested, ensuring the medication is still appropriate for my body. They ask me questions
more relevant to my well-being now, so maybe things are changing. It's saddening that I had to
learn about positive and negative symptoms in the way I did.

I haven't explicitly stated this but I'll say it now - most treatments for schizophrenia do not
address negative symptoms. But! I am, quite literally, now learning of a combination medication that
treats schizophrenia in an entirely different way. It's effective at combating negative symptoms.
I'm curious. It's a combination of drugs called xanomeline - which stimulates a receptor of
acetylcholine in the brain - and trospium - which blocks the same receptors in the body. The
trospium prevents the xanomeline from producing side effects in the body, while the xanomeline acts
on the brain. This actually supports the idea I mentioned earlier that nicotine may be used by
schizophrenics to combat some symptoms. The same receptors are stimulated.

Now, what I wonder is - would the good parts of my experience disappear on this new medication? I'm
not sure I'd want that. My current medication is also effective at re-integrating me with society,
and if it ain't broke, as they say. Additionally, I'm not positive this treatment would be covered
by the benefits plans I participate in.

## 4. Belief

So what did I say to get me locked up? I did many things that most would consider inappropriate or
incorrect, but I was simply trying to explain my experience using the tools given to me.

Consider this - for any statement to be true it must be placed in a context. If that context
changes, it's possible the truth value of the statement changes. An example of this is the
statement 'the daytime sky is blue'. This is true in the context of Earth, but on Mars, this is
not the case. Extreme example, but this principle is universal.

Many choose to believe explanations of the foundations of reality without compelling evidence, but
belief may close the mind to new learning. Here is some reasoning: If a god-like entity is
all-knowing, all-present and it reasons, it must be aware of this devil character. In fact,
everything that the devil does is part of god's plan, just like everything else that happens,
apparently. So, the devil's plan is known to god, making god complicit. To me, assumptions begin to
fall apart there.

If people weren't as tied to their beliefs, I'm not sure that the same number of mental health
issues would present themselves. If there's no longer a disagreement (stemming from differing
beliefs), there's just communication and hopefully some attempt at understanding each other's
perspectives.

I once argued at length with a nurse, upon intake, about how Lucifer - in my understanding of the
concept - can't really be called 'evil'. She didn't buy it, told me he was absolutely the devil and
that I was wrong. This shouldn't happen, especially as a first experience during treatment. What I
mean is, caregivers need to detach from their beliefs and become aware that they are just that,
beliefs. Those in distress are often unreceptive to ideas that are misaligned with their world view,
so why start a fight?

## 5. Psychosis

I'll start by noting I haven't actually read other accounts of psychosis, this is all from my own
experience. I plan to read some when I finish this document.

But what did I do? What did I say?

I said things like 'I am Lucifer'. Shit really hit the fan when I tried to explain that this Jesus
fellow I'd been hearing so much about was probably Lucifer, too.

So why did _I_ say those things? I'm told many people with the same psychological diagnoses as me
say similar things. Why? Well, there are many reasons this could be the case, but for me it was
simply my experience. I can't speak for others. Here are a few examples (there are many more but
these are the most accessible for those who aren't me).

My initials are JC. This is a simple one. Many protagonists in popular culture and of course the
Christian religion have these initials. It got me thinking about this at a very young age (about
six). No big deal though, common initials for English names.

My name is in the first letters of the months in our current English calendar (it's Jason - July,
August, September, October, November). This isn't that impressive in isolation, either.

A high school girlfriend's name was the same as my mother's, and for a long time this made an
impression on me since this was allegedly the case for Jesus. Imagine a single story, replaying
over and over with a different cast, details updated for the context but with an underlying
consistency in a sequence of impactful events.

I won many competitions when I was young. Things seemed too easy for me, though I struggled with
many social interactions.

I'm effectively an only child.

I began to think the world was made for me, and I that it was possible I was the reincarnation of
someone called Jesus (I didn't quite understand how). I know this is solipsistic, but this was my
experience. I thought it was possible my life was some kind of training or conditioning to take on
that role, whatever that entailed. I was conflicted, since at a young age I began posing questions
that could not be answered by religion alone. I was open to the possibility, however, that we simply
didn't have a scientific explanation for some of the things religions claim. The fact that we don't
have an explanation doesn't necessarily make them untrue.

Later in life, during treatment, I became overwhelmed thinking about a looming resource crisis. My
name is an anagram of Warden Bonus Clone Jar; this makes me feel additional responsibility for our
planet. When vital resources are constrained to crisis levels, it creates inequity, conflict, and
instability.

I asked for an answer (I simply thought). I wanted to know if we were in danger of overpopulating,
and if we were, I knew the response I got would be deadly (it made sense to me that this would
signal overpopulation). So, I agreed (in tears) to sacrifice my grandmother who raised me as a token
of my commitment to a solution and a means of understanding. I felt someone from my family needed to
participate in some otherwise unbiased culling. No voices were involved.

It sounds like it makes no sense, I understand that, but I simply believed all this and offered. I
was immediately told that, instead, my other grandmother would die. I wasn't as close to her, and
this relieved me. I was informed in a simple way - a can of soda pop with a version of my paternal
grandmother's name on it, combined with the word 'go'. To me, I read it and my brain immediately
thought 'oh, she goes instead'. I didn't put the can there, someone else receiving treatment did -
at just the right time.

![Faygo Cola](./assets/Faygo%20Cola.png)

I mentioned my name was Jason. Well, on Friday, November 13th, 2015, months after my treatment, I
awoke from a nap at around 4pm Toronto time and felt absolutely awful. I wasn't sure what was wrong.
Maybe it was just because of my name (Jason), popular culture (Friday the 13th), and my psychosis.
A friend sent me a message letting me know about the fatal terrorist attack in Paris, and I felt
worse - I felt like this was the signal I was waiting for. A few days later I got a message from my
aunt telling me my grandmother had passed away of natural causes that Friday.

![Grandmother Obituary (Redacted)](./assets/Grandmother%20Obituary%20(Redacted).png)

After all this happened (or maybe just before?), still in psychosis, I thought it would be fun to
open a random book to see what information it had in it. I was at a book store, so I chose one
with a whimsical name that I figured would have something in it for me - 'Lucifer's Hammer'. I
opened to a page number that meant something to me and to my astonishment the first words on the
page were Pieter Jakov. I was standing beside my friend, Jakob Peter.

The next paragraph was even more intriguing - it mentioned a security device named the SAC that was
responsible for messaging. It said the solution to the problem faced in the book may be in
California. Within half a page, it referenced a name: Bennet Rosten.

Why is this relevant? I was listed as an inventor of a patent around 2008 or 2009. I had named the
main component SAC (Signing Appliance Core). When I built the SAC, my manager was named Ross
Bennett. The book was written three years before I was born, and this was the first I'd seen of it.
I mention this for another reason - if my memory is correct, a trial (and I presume production)
deployment of the software was in Paris, and the piece I built was, in part, responsible for
stopping things like terrorist attacks on larger venues like stadiums, hospitals and malls.

![Lucifer's Hammer Edition Page](./assets/Lucifer's%20Hammer%20Edition%20Page.png)

![Patent Acronyms (Redacted)](./assets/Patent%20Acronyms%20(Redacted).png)

Sometimes it feels like my life is scripted, or that I'm engineering reality. Part of that process
may involve testing the security of the environment using methods similar to penetration testing.
Penetration testing is a software technique employed where one attempts to infiltrate their own
systems to ensure such an attack can be withstood.

More recently, I wanted confirmation that this was an integrated interaction with reality,
so when I leased my car I decided that I would make the monthly payment $666. I often do things like
this to amuse myself. I expected a response, but I wasn't quite sure what it would be. The receipt I
received for my downpayment ended with the number 666! Pretty on the nose, though there's a high
probability (1:1000) of a random outcome mimicking success.

![Lease Agreement (Redacted)](./assets/Lease%20Agreement%20(Redacted).png)

![Lease Receipt (Redacted)](./assets/Lease%20Receipt%20(Redacted).png)

When others tell me that they don't understand or don't believe what I say, it increasingly feels
like a universal conspiracy. It's pretty easy, once you realize reality may be fed to your
consciousness like a streaming service, to jump to all kinds of paranoid interpretations that
explain away why no one believes facts you present. To someone in psychosis, this is often easier
to accept than rational humans rejecting facts. During treatment, I made various claims about the
nature of reality and my role in it - but I no longer claim to understand why events like these
happen to me with high frequency, I'm merely sharing them with you.

There's nothing in particular about these facts that extend beyond our planet, or even humanity. I
didn't travel to Saturn and find Russell's teapot with my name engraved on it, for example - but
humans did concoct the Gregorian English calendar month names. It's possible, then, that my
experience is the result of a collective cognitive effort. This makes more sense to me than a
universal conspiracy.

In the spirit of helping others understand, it feels to me like each of these could remain true
under differing assumptions of the basis of my experience:

1) My life has been scripted/engineered to make me desire what I later achieve, resulting in
positive feelings of accomplishment.
2) I'm constructing the experience by small feedback tweaks into the human network I am part of,
treating it like an AI that serves up responses to my queries.

I'm not sure from my perspective it's even possible to determine the difference between them. To
me, reality often feels like a message I'm interpreting. One can see from the things I'm saying
how a schizophrenic could think they are part of an immersive film or game where both of the above
co-exist, like a choose your own adventure book.

Regarding the second perceived truth, it's possible that schizophrenics are a divergent form of
humans communicating through the human network as a single entity, their experience in delayed and
asynchronous processing giving them a natural advantage in the use of our shared network. If
schizophrenics treat their experiences as extensions of their mind, they could all be using
humanity as a collective memory, and if the conditions were right (like details from my
psychosis) they may identify as the same entity from that collective memory, which could explain why
we're all (allegedly) saying the same things.

A few potential explanations for reality that align with my experience are:

1) I created a simulation immersed myself in it.
2) I am in a lucid dream.
3) I am sedated and being psychologically trained.
4) I am playing or developing a 'video' game.

I could go on, but ultimately I'm limited by my own experience and it is constrained by my
perceivable context - which I consider to be everything beyond the boundary of thought that I can
observe. My brain, my body, humans, this planet, reality - are all part of my perceivable context.
This question extends beyond observation and that limited context, so it isn't necessarily the case
that I can understand its nature.

I'm often asked the question, at this point, 'So if there are other schizophrenics, what makes you
unique?' It's harder to explain this one - why reality isn't someone else's experience - and I can't
be certain. But I would argue that I wouldn't be writing this if it weren't mine. Someone else
would. It's my choice, you see. This is a very personal exposure, and it's actually dangerous to me
to express some of these ideas, because of others' beliefs. Additionally, the manner in which I'm
delivering this does not rely on others to verify the assertion that I authored it, and I even wrote
the software that created the proof.

My original intent was to share my findings with others and ask for help establishing
correlations that led to a better understanding of our reality. I figured if we could come up with a
reasonable number of explanations for the existence of reality, we could then work to determine
which kind of statements appeared to hold true in all plausible explanations, even if they were
unprovable. These truths could then be a starting point for developing a universal theory of the
nature of reality.

Like I mentioned earlier, I now choose to not believe any explanation of reality's nature. Though,
I do assume some things I perceive to be true that appear to persist through all these
explanations - and others may disagree. I'm open to other possibilities, though coincidence is
hard for me to accept, it's doubtful I could be convinced of the absolute truth of any explanation
of reality. Some would choose to believe that a sentient god was communicating with them.
Ultimately the truths underlying our reality could be thought of as representing god themselves,
but this doesn't provide evidence of intent. It feels more like a computer I'm operating, or a game
I'm playing, from the perspective of my experience (which is part of the context of my
understanding).

## 6. Authenticity

Some time in the mid-2010s I tried to figure out a way to distribute my ideas. I didn't want anyone
to be able to claim them as theirs, and I didn't want others to make any changes. I wanted to
cryptographically secure the authenticity of my writing, but I didn't have a good way to manage
my signing keys. I naively wrote a few things and signed them with a key appropriate for a popular
cryptocurrency but needed something more robust.

In 2018 I began work at a software company, after I found medication that allowed me to integrate
with society again. That company was sold, and the former CEO found some investors to start
another - one focusing on cryptography and identity. I was a natural fit to be an engineer there.
This company sent me to California, for the first time since I read Lucifer's Hammer, where I
learned of a state-of-the-art technique to create assertions in a verifiable and unalterable way
that doesn't depend on external authorities and services - and this is how I'm packaging what you
are reading.

Related to psychosis - the KERI AID I'm using to secure this message actually has a version of my
name embedded in it. If it is my delegate, it's kind of like a representation of me, my digital
DNA. The identifier `EHhnRAdKqaF4ux-J4CZD5gXmnh45OQO13cFOdbcmCXNB` may look like gibberish at first
glance, but as a coder I saw it immediately. In hacker parlance - `F4ux-J4C`, or 'Faux JAC', my
initials. Keep in mind this identifier was randomly generated. I computed the odds of generating
such an identifier to be about 1 in 80,000,000,000. Odds of winning the lottery are around 1
in 300,000,000. If I wanted to trick people into thinking this had happened randomly when it hadn't,
I would have to spend 2,536 computing years doing it. I didn't do that.

## 7. Conclusion

Attempting to select a correct interpretation of reality may be pointless, we may never figure it
out. This doesn't mean we can't speculate, it simply means may not be able to know. There's no
point _believing_ any of these explanations, there is instead a most probable interpretation given
the current knowledge of our context.

I won't, however, remark on what I think is most probable, because new information could change my
mind.

So then, what do I believe? Nothing, as I should. From where I stand, those holding belief are the
'crazy' ones.

This doesn't mean I operate randomly. I still base decisions on context and assumption. Please stop
labelling me, and allow me more input into my own treatment.

## A. Voices

So why did I mention voices only once, to say I wasn't hearing them? Why didn't I discuss
hallucinations? No reason. I have had them, with and without the aid of drugs. I feel like they
didn't really impact my life that much. My psychosis, on the other hand, totally dominated my
behaviour.

Some of the most vivid examples of my hallucinations are:

1) My grandfather's voice telling me to 'come home tonight' as I woke up in treatment. I was trapped
there, and I didn't tell anyone - so I actually began planning escape.
2) Scattered voices while spending time with a friend and smoking cannabis for the first time in
months. It was hard to discern most, but what I did hear was 'someone's got their wavelengths all
messed up', which at the time made me feel like someone/something was communicating directly to me
and telling me I had misconfigured my communication channel.
3) Whispers on the toilet. This is a weird one. There was a bit of running water that was babbling
and for about 2 days my brain interpreted these noises as voices, every time I was in the washroom.
Things like this could explain accounts of hauntings.
4) Crucifixion on Easter. This one was pretty intense, and visual. I wasn't just hearing voices, it
was immersive.

I've had several more experiences (and some lucid dreams) but those are the ones that come to mind.
I believe most of them are simply a misinterpretation of information that is already in my mind.
Think about this: if our brain is a network of communicating pieces, it's possible one of the pieces
incorrectly interprets another piece.

Sometimes the voices are under my control, sometimes they aren't. Sometimes there are many,
sometimes there are not. Sometimes they loop, sometimes they don't. The most damaging to my
behaviour are the looping voices that feel out of my control. In the worst case, there are also
many. It isn't that I would base my actions on the things I hear, it's more like something that
truly disturbs me that won't go away. The case of my grandfather's voice is unique; I was trapped
and did want to plan escape. The voice was simply encouragement.

The #1 reason schizophrenics end up in the hospital is because of reports of hearing voices. Yet,
for me at least, this didn't really present a problem. Perhaps it's still a reasonable proxy, but
there are interesting ideas from the Rosenhan Experiment (On Being Sane In Insane Places) that
suggest we may need to re-evaluate.

## B. Audio

Yesterday I [recorded myself](./assets/Making%20Making%20Sense%20Make%20Sense.mp3) reading this
writing, and when I uploaded the recording to source control the display size was 66.6mb. Jackpot.
It was the first bounce, and I simply stripped data tags and extended file information from the
